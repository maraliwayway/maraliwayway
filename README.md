## Hi there, I'm Mara! 👋  

I'm a **second-year Computing Science student** at Simon Fraser University (SFU) in Burnaby, British Columbia 🇨🇦. 

For over **3 years**, I’ve been teaching as a coding instructor, working with organizations like **Code Ninjas**, **SFU Science Alive**, and hosting workshops at events like **Try/Catch 2024**, an outreach event designed for female and non-binary high school students.  

My interests include 🎨 **UX/UI Design**, 💻 **Full-Stack Development**, 🌍 **Tech for Good**.

I aspire to continue blending **teaching, outreach, and coding** into a career as a full-stack developer -- empower others while building innovative solutions.

Happy to connect with you! Here is my 💼 [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maraliwayway/)
