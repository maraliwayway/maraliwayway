## About Me
Hi! I'm Mara, a Computing Science undergraduate student at SFU. Nice to meet you. :)
- I’m in my second year and have completed courses like Intro to Software Engineering, Data Structures & Programming, and Client-Side Web Development. I'm planning to pursue a concentration in Artificial Intelligence and a minor in Statistics
- I currently focus on front-end development using tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks and libraries including React.js, Next.js, Leaflet.js, and p5.js
- Mentorship and teaching are a big part of who I am. Over the past 3 years, I’ve taught coding workshops through organizations like Code Ninjas and SFU Science Alive, and I’ve led sessions at outreach events and hackathons to help younger students see themselves in tech
- I love connecting with others who share the same passion. I currently serve as a Student Ambassador for the SFU Faculty of Applied Sciences, and I’m also the Incoming Co-President of SFU Women in Computing Science

*What now and what's next?*
- I’m building a full-stack e-commerce website for a photocard commissions business with a growing following of 2,700+ on Instagram
- I’m diving deeper into AI/ML, Python, and back-end development to round out my skill set
- I’m open to collaborations on web apps and AI/ML projects! I’d love to join a supportive, impact-driven team through co-op or internship opportunities where I can grow as a developer and contribute to real-world solutions
