## Hi there, I'm Mara! 👋  

I'm a **second-year Computing Science student** at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia 🇨🇦. 

For over **3 years**, I’ve been teaching as a coding instructor, working with organizations like [Code Ninjas](https://www.codeninjas.com/), [SFU Science Alive](https://sciencealive.ca/), and hosting workshops at events like [Try/Catch 2024](https://trycatch.cs.sfu.ca/), an outreach event designed for female and non-binary high school students (Fun fact: I help developed the website). 

My interests include 🎨 **UX/UI Design**, 💻 **Web Development**, 🌍 **Tech for Good**.

I aspire to continue blending **teaching, outreach, and coding** into a career as a software or full-stack developer — empowering others while building innovative solutions.

Happy to [connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maraliwayway/) with you!
