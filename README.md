# Mara Liwayway David — @maraliwayway
Hello! My name is Mara, and I'm a third-year undergraduate student in Computing Science at Simon Fraser University.

I'm passionate about full-stack development, AI/ML for social good, and community leadership. My favourite languages are Python, TypeScript, and C++, but I’m always open to learning new technologies and expanding my skills. 

I'm currently seeking Fall 2025 co-op opportunities where I can grow as a developer and continue building software that empowers others.
